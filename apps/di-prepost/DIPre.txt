Introduction to data interpretation questions


Now, we will interpret some results. We'll show you two different scenarios:
Testing students' memories and Launching Rockets. 

For each scenario, we will as you to interpret 5 different sets of possible results. 

OK, let's start!


2. 
Memory Experiment

Chris wanted to see whether people are able to remember more pictures or words. 
Chris wrote a word on each of 16 cue cards. 
Then Chris drew a picture for each of the same 15 words on a second set of 15 cue cards. 


3. 
Chris asked each of his 5 friends to study the cards with words for one minute on their own.


4. 

Then he gathered 5 different friends and he asked them to study the set of cards with pictures for one minute on their own.


5. 
After one minute was up, each friend write down all of the words or picture they could remember. (Chris gave them all one minute to do that. ) 


6.
 Next we'll show you 5 different possible sets of results of this experiment. We will ask you to interpret each set of results. 


7. 
You'll see tables with the number of correct responses for each person. 


8. 

Possible Memory Results: #1 of 5



9.
Below is the first set of possible results for the number of correct responses for each friend. 

Q1: What do these results suggest students remember better?
A: 
Words 
Pictures 
Neither (they remember words and pictures the same).

Q2: Please briefly explain why you said these results suggest that students remember [students choice here] better. 

Q3: How sure are you that students remembered [students choice here] better?  

Not at all sure

Fairly sure
Very sure

Scenario#2: Model Rocket Launches 


18.
Module Rocket Launches Experiment

Sophia wanted to see whether model rockets fly better with a curved body or a straight body. She built two rockets: one with a curved body and one with a straight body. But everything else about the rockets was the same. 



19.
Sophia launched the curved body rocket five times and recorded how high it flew. Then she launched the straight body rocket five times and recorded how high it flew. (She was careful to make everything about how she launched the rockets the same.)

20. 

Next we'll show you 5 different possible sets of results of this experiment. We will ask you to interpret each set of results... 

21.  
Possible Rocket Height Results: #1 of 5

22.

Below is the first set of possible results for each height the rocket traveled (in meters). 

Q1: What do these results suggest about which type of rocket flew higher? ***Note: "Neither" means both rocket types flew the same height. 

A: 
Curved
Straight
Neither

Q2: Please briefly explain why you said these results suggest that [students choice here] rocket(s) flew higher.

Not at all sure
A little sure
Fairly sure
Very sure
Absolutely sure
