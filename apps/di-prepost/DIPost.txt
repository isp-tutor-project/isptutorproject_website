1. 

We'd like to see what you learned about interpreting results from the lesson. We will show you two different scenarios: Racing Toy Cars and Testing Student Learning. For each scenario, we will ask you to interpret five different sets of possible results. 

Let's begin. 



2. 
Scenario #1: Racing Toy Cars

Ethan wanted to see whether toy cars can go faster when they have which wheels or thin wheels. He built two toy cars: one with thick wheels and one with thin wheels. But everything else about the cars was the same. 

3. 
Ethan made a ramp. He started with the toy car with the thick wheels from the rest at the top of the ramp and recorded how fast it was moving at the bottom of the ramp. He did this five times. 

Then he did the same thing with the toy car with thin wheels. He recorded the speed of this toy car at the bottom of the ramp five times.

4. 

 Next we'll show you 5 different possible sets of results of this experiment. We will ask you to interpret each set of results.

15. Scenario #2: Student Learning Experiment

16.
Student Learning Experiment

Taylor wanted to see whether people learn more if they study by themselves at the library or home. 

17.
Taylor asked five friends to study for 1 hours at the library on their own. 

18.
Then she asked five different friends to study for 1 hour at their own home. 


19. 
The next day, everyone took q quiz on what they learned. They had 15 minutes to finish the quiz. 

20.
Next, we'll show you five different possible sets of results for this experiment. We will ask you to interpret each set of results. 

You will see tables with the number of correct answers for each person. 


21. Possible Learning Results: #1 of 5
