    <h1>Summary: Representing and <b>Interpreting</b> your data</h1>

<p class="text-xl">
    When interpreting your data, 
    the first thing to do is (#1) <b>compare means across conditions</b> (for example, Hot or Cold) to see which has a higher mean.
 </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
        Then you can consider the (#2) <b>Size of difference in means.</b> As the difference in means gets bigger, we can be more sure that the
        difference is due to the independent variable (for example, hot/cold water)
        rather than experimenter or random errors.
