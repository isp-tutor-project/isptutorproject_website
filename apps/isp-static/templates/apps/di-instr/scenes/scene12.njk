        <b>What is the <u>mean</u> (or average) value?</b>
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
        The mean is a number that describes a typical value for a set of numbers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
        You can calculate the mean of a set of numbers by finding the SUM of
        the numbers. Then, you divide that sum by the number of numbers in
        the set.
