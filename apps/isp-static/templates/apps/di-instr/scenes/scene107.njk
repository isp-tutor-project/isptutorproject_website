        There is less spread (or a smaller range) for both the Sugar and Salt
        conditions<br> for Frankiâ€™s results (Results F). <br>Less spread may mean that Franki was more careful in doing her
        experiment than Ethan was.
        <br/>
        So, Results F are probably higher quality.
