        There is a larger difference in means between the Hot and Cold#1
        condition. So, the Cold#1 <br/>
        results are stronger evidence that water temperature affects crystal
        growth. Because this <br/>
        difference is larger, it is less likely to have been caused by
        experimenter or random errors.
