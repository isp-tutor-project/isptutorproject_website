    <p class="text-lg">
        The mean crystal growth weight is greater in the hot than in the cold
        water condition.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        On average, crystals grew 18 mg more in the Hot water condition than in
        the Cold water condition.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        So, these results suggest that crystals grew more in the hot water.
