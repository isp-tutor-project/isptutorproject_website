{% block research_summary %}
    <p class="poster-text text-xs">
        Different colors are associated with different frequencies of light waves. Waves with higher frequencies have more energy.
        However, I could not find anything about an object's color affecting its speed.

{% block hypo %}
    <p class="poster-text text-xs">
        I predict that the yellow ball will roll faster than the red ball because yellow light has a higher frequency than red light. 
        So, a yellow ball would have more energy than a red ball and roll faster.

            First, put the red ball on the ramp above the green lever (shown above).

            Release the lever so the ball rolls.

            Record the speed of the ball at the bottom of the ramp.

            Move the lever to the top of the ramp.

{% block conclusion %}
    <p class="poster-text text-xs">
        The results of my experiment were inconsistent with my
        hypothesis. The color of the ball does not affect the speed of the ball at 
        the bottom of the ramp.
