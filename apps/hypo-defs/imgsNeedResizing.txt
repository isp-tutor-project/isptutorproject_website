slide #s are using Steph's powerpoint

slide4:
iv2dvWithArrow.png scale to 55% of current size


slide 5 & 6:
defPagesCptMap.jpg  
size ok. requires labels added to arrows as in Steph's powerpoint, perhaps .png 
instead because it contains text (up to you)


slide 8:
defGraph.png 50%
causeGraph.png 50%
corrGraph.png 50%

slide9:

temperaturegif.gif  15%?  I think we may need to play around with this one's size (email to me rather than commit to github)
densitygraphic.jpg  50%

slide10:

comic.jpg   70%   (might want to make text bigger and may .png. again up to you)
coffeegraphic.jpg 70%

slide 11:

correlation.png 40%
IceCreamSwimming.png 50%
graph1.png 40%
graph2.png 40%
