Data Interpretation Lesson Introduction

Once we have conducted a good experiment, where we have controlled all
variables except our independent variable, we need to interpret the results.



Intro-2 
---
layout: single_column
---

When interpreting experimental results, many students find a difference in mean
across conditions and conclude that the independent variable they tested caused the difference.

But this may not be true!



Intro-3  
---
layout: single_column
---

How can we tell whether the independent variable <b><i>really did</i></b>
cause the difference?

For example, how can we know that our results really do show that cold water
makes crystals grow more than hot water (or the reverse)?



Intro-4  
---
layout: single_column
---

In experiments, the results will almost never be the same-even in a single condition!
And even if we did our best to control variables!

For example, in the crystal growth experiment, it is very unlikely that the weight of the crystal
growth will be the same for each trial in one condition.

Intro-5 
---
layout: single_column
---

There are two general reasons why results differ from trial to trial:

(1) Errors made by the experimenter (the person doing the experiment)
(2) Other random factors in the environment during the experiment.

Graph_S5.6.png



Intro-6 
---
layout: single_column
---

(1) Experimenter errors: Differences in results may be caused by things like the experimenter making errors when measuring the result (for example, weighing the crystals incorrectly or not recording the right number for weight), and slight differences in the procedure for each trial (for example, using different amounts of water or salt in different trials).

Scientist_S6.jpg



Intro-7
---
layout: single_column
---

(2) Other random factors: Differences in results may also be caused by things the
experimenter can’t control, like temperature or humidity of the room, or problems with
devices used to measure results (for example, the weight the scale gives depends on
where the crystal is placed on the scale).

Scientist_S7.jpg

So, both experimenter errors and other random factors can cause differences in
the weights from trial to trial.



Intro-8  
---
layout: single_column
---

Now, let’s say we ran a second set of 5 trials of the Hot water condition and got these results:

Graph_S8.png

Notice again that the weights differ from trial to trial.



Intro-9 
---
layout: single_column
---

The mean (or average) weights differ between the first and second sets of 5 trials.

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-10  
---
layout: single_column
---

It’s very unlikely that the means would happen to be exactly the same, even
if you are measuring the same thing!

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-11 
---
layout: single_column
---

But, we know this difference in means is just a result of experimenter errors and other random factors.
After all, all of these trials were in the same (hot water) condition!

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-12 
---
layout: single_column
---

So, when we are interpreting the results of experiments, we can’t conclude that the independent
variable caused a difference between conditions just because the means are different!

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-13 
---
layout: single_column
---

For example, it would be silly to say that these results show that crystals grew
more in hot water than in hot water.

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-14 
---
layout: single_column
---

Again, a difference in means that you get in your experiment could just be from differences in
results that are caused by experimenter errors and other random factors.

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-15 
---
layout: single_column
---

In this lesson, we will discuss how we can be more sure that there really is a difference
between conditions when the difference in means between conditions is bigger and less sure when the difference is smaller.

Graph_S9-16.png



Intro-16  
---
layout: single_column
---

For example, for these two (hot water) conditions, the difference in means is 28 mg - 25 mg. So,
this is 3 mg difference (it’s pretty small).

Data Interpretation Lesson

Now, we will look at some possible results for this experiment on crystal growth, comparing growth in HOT and COLD water.

You will learn how to represent your data so it is easier to interpret.

Here are some POSSIBLE Results (#1) for the crystal growth experiment. The numbers in the table
below are weights of crystal growth on a string in water.

OK; let’s think about how we can organize and summarize the data in each condition.
Then, we can interpret the results of this experiment.

Results: weight of crystal growth

1_DITable2-6.png

First, we will sort results from smallest to
largest in each condition. This will help us to see if
there is any data that look “strange”.

“Strange” data includes outliers (numbers that are too big or small, compared to other numbers).

Right column:

Sort data

The results for each condition are now sorted from smallest to largest weights.

So, if you start at the first measurement, 20 mg, for Hot water, you
can see that the weights get bigger as you move down the list.

The same is true for the weights for cold water.

We would first add all of the weights together.

The total is 631.3.

Then we divide that total by 15 (since there are 15 numbers in
 the set).

631.3 / 15 = 42.1

That would give us the mean of 42.1 lb.

What is the mode in a set of numbers?

The mode is the number (or range of numbers) that occurs most often in a set of numbers.

For example, the most dog weights (6 of them) are in the range between 40 and 50 lb.

So, the mode for this set of data is between 40-50 lb.

Cold #1 is the strongest evidence for this prediction, since crystals grew 18 mg more in Hot than Cold water.
Cold #2 is the next strongest evidence, since crystals grew only 8 mg more in Hot than Cold water.
Cold #3 is weakest evidence for this prediction. Crystals actually grew 18 mg more in the Cold than Hot water!

Summary so far

We have talked about how it’s important to first sort data from smallest to largest. This helps us tell
if there is any “strange” data. “Strange” data includes “outliers”, data that is much
bigger or smaller than the rest of the data in a condition.

Here are two examples of histograms you saw in the previous lesson. The outliers in
these histograms are circled.

Summary so far

We also talked about calculating the mean (or average) for each condition. This is often the
best way to summarize your data in each condition.

Then you can see which condition (e.g., Hot or Cold) has a higher mean.

But, we need to look at other evidence before interpreting the results..


51a

layout: single_column

Summary so far

You also need to look at how small or big the difference in means is between conditions.
(Just subtract the means across conditions).


52
---
layout: single_column
---

Summary so far

As the difference in means gets bigger, we can be more sure that the difference is due to the
independent variable (e.g., hot/cold water) rather than experimenter or random errors.

Summary so far

So, the size of the difference between conditions in means is one clue to whether there is a difference between conditions caused by the independent variable.


54

layout: single_column

The range of the data, or how spread out the data are is another clue to whether
there is a difference between conditions.

How the Range of Data Affects Interpretation of Results

Next, we’ll show you the results from two experiments on salt crystal growth:
Experiment A and Experiment B.

We will ask you to interpret the data from each experiment.

Two students, Ann and Bob, separately ran this experiment.
Ann’s results are Results A. Bob’s results are Results B.
We will ask you to interpret both sets of results.

Let’s look at the hot water conditions...


68

layout: ????

FIXME: 26_Graph_S66.png (with arrows???)

In the Hot water conditions...
For Results A, the data range from 20 to 50 mg: a 30 mg range.
For Results B, the data range from 10 to 50 mg: a 40 mg range.


69

layout: ???

FIXME: 26_Graph_S66.png (with arrows???)

For the cold water conditions, the ranges for both Results A and B are 30 mg
(the data on the x-axis is from 0 to 30).

Let’s answer the same question, looking at the number data (instead of the histograms).

Both the histogram and table results show that the data from Results A are LESS spread out.
In the table, the range for the hot conditions is less for Results A (21 mg) than Results B (31 mg).


73

74

30_ABTable_S75.png

75

layout: single_column

31_Graphs_S75.png

One possible reason that the Results A (Ann’s) data are less spread is that Ann followed the procedure
more closely than Bob.


76
---
layout: single_column
---

32_Graphic_S76.jpg

For example, Ann may have weighed the crystals all exactly two weeks (336 hours) later.
Or, Ann may have made sure that the initial hot water temperature was exactly the same for all 5 trials
(same for the initial cold water temperatures).


77
---
layout: single_column

33_Graphic_S77.jpg

Another possible reason that the Results A (Ann’s) data are less spread is that Ann measured the results
(the weight of the crystal growth) more carefully than Bob did.


78

In general, less spread in data indicates that the data is more accurate.

When there is less spread in data:

difference in means.

Results A are stronger evidence that water temperature affects crystal growth. This is because the
Results A data are less spread out than the Results B data.


83

layout: single_column

For the same difference in means, data that is less spread out-or narrower-is stronger evidence
that there is a difference between conditions.

We will now look at the results (Results C and D) from two other students who conducted this experiment
(Carol and Dwayne).

We will look at their data tables, which they have already sorted from lowest to highest weight in each
condition...


89
---
layout: single_column
---

36_GraphicS_89.jpg

Both Carol and Dwayne found that the mean weight in the Cold condition was 35 mg and that the
weight in the Hot condition was 25 mg. So, both students found that the crystals grew on
average 10 mg more in the Cold condition. But these results are NOT equally strong evidence that
crystals grow more in cold than hot water!

The results with LESS spread are stronger evidence that cold water really makes crystals grow more...

Results D are (much!) less spread out-or have a smaller range-than Results C.


92

layout: single_column

38_CDTable_S92.png

Looking at the Hot conditions first...
The data for Results C ranges from 9 mg to 44 mg: 35 mg.
The data for Results D ranges from 23 mg to 28 mg: only 5 mg.


93

39_CDTable_S93.png

Now, looking at the Cold conditions...the data for Results C ranges from 14 mg to 55 mg: 41 mg.

The data for Results D ranges from 32 mg to 38 mg: only 6 mg.


94

layout: single_column

This is because less spread is one sign that the experiment was done more carefully. For example,
Dwayne, who got Results D, may have followed the procedure much more closely for each of the
5 trials than Carol (who got results C).


99

43_Diagram_S98-100.png

For Results D, we can be more sure that the means are about 25 mg for the hot water and 35 mg for
the cold water condition.  For Results C, we would be less sure that the means were accurate
because the results are more spread out.

Two other students, Ethan and Franki ran a similar experiment about crystal growth.

They both (independently) investigated the research question:
Does the type of crystal affect the amount of crystal growth on a string in water after three weeks?

They followed similar procedures.  They used the starting temperature of the water and
the same initial amount of water across conditions of their experiments.

After they finished their experiment, they both showed you the mean for each condition...

Both experiments found a difference of 5mg in crystal growth. But they were in the opposite directions!
Ethan’s results showed that sugar grew more, and Franki’s results showed that salt grew more. So, we
don’t know WHAT to believe. We need more evidence!

You ask to see their “raw” data, or the measurements they recorded to calculate the means.

First you double-check to make sure that there are no obvious “outliers” in the data. (There are not.)
You then make sure that the four averages are correct. (They are).

There is less spread-or a smaller range-for both the Sugar and Salt conditions for
Franki’s results (Results F).

Less spread may mean that Franki was more careful in doing her experiment than Ethan was.

So, Results F are probably higher quality.

* Sugar crystals grow better on a string in water than salt crystals.
* Again, it’s impossible to even guess.

At the science fair, we talked to Ethan about his experiment. It turns out that he forgot to count
the number of spoonfuls of salt or sugar that he added to the water.

This is one thing that contributed to the larger spread in his results (and also maybe why his results
were in the opposite direction from Franki’s results).
