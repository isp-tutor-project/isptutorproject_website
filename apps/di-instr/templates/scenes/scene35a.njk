        The mean crystal growth weight is (again) greater in the hot than in 
        the cold water condition.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        On average, crystals grew 8 mg more in the Hot water condition than in
        the Cold #2 condition.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        So, these results also show that crystals grew more in the hot water.
