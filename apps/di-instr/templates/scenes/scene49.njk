    <p class="text-l">
        Cold #1 is the strongest evidence for this prediction, <br>since crystals
        grew 18 mg more in Hot than Cold water.
    </p>

    <p class="text-l">
        Cold #2 is the next strongest evidence, <br>since crystals grew only 8 mg
        more in Hot than Cold water.
    </p>

    <p class="text-l">
        Cold #3 is weakest evidence for this prediction. <br>Crystals actually grew
        18 mg more in the Cold than Hot water!
