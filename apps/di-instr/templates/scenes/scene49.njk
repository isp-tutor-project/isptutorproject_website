        Cold #1 is the strongest evidence for this prediction, since crystals
        grew 18 mg more in Hot than Cold water.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Cold #2 is the next strongest evidence, since crystals grew only 8 mg
        more in Hot than Cold water.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
        Cold #3 is weakest evidence for this prediction. Crystals actually grew 
        18 mg more in the Cold than Hot water!
