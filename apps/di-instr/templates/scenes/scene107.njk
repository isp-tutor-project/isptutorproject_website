        There is less spread-or a smaller range-for both the Sugar and Salt
        conditions for Frankiâ€™s results (Results F).
        <br/>
        Less spread may mean that Franki was more careful in doing her
        experiment than Ethan was.
        <br/>
        So, Results F are probably higher quality.
