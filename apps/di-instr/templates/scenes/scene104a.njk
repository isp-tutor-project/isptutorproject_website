        Both experiments found a difference of 5mg in crystal growth. But they
        were in the opposite directions! <br/>
        Ethan’s results showed that sugar grew more, and Franki’s results showed
        that salt grew more. <br/>So, we don’t know WHAT to believe. We need more
        evidence!
