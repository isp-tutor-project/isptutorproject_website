# isptutorproject_website

This will *eventually* be the monorepo for the entire go.isptutor.org website, and perhaps some of the other websites.  This is currently only the *new* stuff and the legacy stuff needs to be moved here (from 46 separate git repos!)

This makes use of yarn workspaces.  The workspaces (packages) are namespaced as `@isptutorproject`

Since a monorepo has so many subdirs, vs code's file explorer can become unusable quite easily.  To help with this, I've created multiple *vs code* workspaces (not to be confused with *yarn* workspaces - to differentiate the two, think of yarn workspaces a javascript packages and vs code workspaces as editor configurations).  I've used a vs code extension called 'Monorepo Workspace' which makes it easy to select which folders you want into your (vs code) workspace and then saved them as app-specific workspaces which list the minimal folders you need when working on that app.This also minimizes the npm scripts listed as well.  


the **yarn** workspaces are contained within the following subdirs: `apps`, `common`, `config`



## Major workspaces listed below, (those unlisted are still skeletons).

```
apps/  <- where web apps live
    di-instr/
    di-prepost/
    homepage/
    hypo/
    isp-static/ *described below*

common/  <- libs/reusable code imported into the web apps
    isp-site-styles/  - styling shared site-wide SCSS
    navbar/
    snackbar/

config/ <- shared build/config stuff to simplify individual app setup
    eleventy-config/
    webpack-config/
```

I believe there will be a `efted` subdir added in the future. the BRM will get added to `apps`.  I think Stefani's captivate projects can be added to `apps`.  games will either be added to apps or to it's own subdir. 


Basically, the apps get built and their build dirs get installed in a 
`wwwroot` subdir of the project's root.  Things are still in quite a state of flux though.   I *think* I'll be adding a `server` subdir as well, but since that will be  Django/Python, it wan't be a yarn workspace.  it's possible that 'wwwroot' will go away and the content will get written to `server/static` or something and 



Each app's javascript and stylesheet stuff is built via webpack.  Each app has a `dist` subdir.  We're using Eleventy (11ty), a static site generator, to generate html from  **nunjucks** (a javascript port of Jinja2) templates. Each app has a `templates` subdir. The html generated by 11ty is placed in `dist`, so that each app is *completely* self-contained within it's "dist" dir, and merely needs to be installed into the site by copying it somewhere and renaming it.
  

`apps/isp-static` (poorly named - historical) is an eleventy setup which merely copies all of the apps/*/dist folders to their appropriate `wwwroot` folder (at the top level of this project).  Since this is no longer a webapp, and simply part of the build process, it should be moved elsewhere

The project root has some npm scripts such as 'build' which trigger the individual apps npm scripts.
